# Setting Up an On-Premises Active Directory Home Lab with Splunk

## Objective

This guide aims to create an on-premises environment consisting of an Active Directory, a domain-joined Windows 10 VM, a Splunk server for log collection, and Kali Linux VM to simulate a brute-force attack on the RDP session of the Windows 10 VM. While this guide uses **Hyper-V** for virtualization, you can also choose **VMware** or **VirtualBox** to complete this setup.

> **Important Security Disclaimer**: This lab environment is for educational purposes only. The techniques demonstrated should only be used in authorized test environments. Never attempt these techniques against systems without explicit permission.

## Creating a NAT Virtual Switch

We'll create a Virtual Switch and configure it with NAT (Network Address Translation) so that our VMs can access the internet. You can either create the virtual switch through Hyper-V Manager and continue the NAT configuration in Powershell or set it up entirely using PowerShell.

For this guide, I will be using the **PowerShell method**.

### Create the NAT Virtual Switch in PowerShell

Run the following command in **PowerShell (Admin mode)** to create the virtual network and assign it a name:

```powershell
New-NetNat -Name "NATNetwork" -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix 192.168.200.0/24
```
This command creates a NAT virtual switch with the name `NATNetwork` and uses the IP range `192.168.200.0/24`.

### Find the Network Interface Index

After creating the virtual switch, we need to find the interface index to configure the NAT gateway:

```powershell
Get-NetAdapter
```

This will display all virtual switches. Look for the adapter name you just created and locate the **ifIndex** (Interface Index).

### Assign an IP Address to the Virtual Switch

Once you have the interface index, assign an IP address to your virtual switch, which will serve as the default gateway for your VMs. For example, if the **ifIndex** is `54`, the command would be:

```powershell
New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.200.1 -PrefixLength 24 -InterfaceIndex 54
```

- `IPAddress`: This will be the default gateway (e.g., `192.168.200.1`).
- `PrefixLength`: This represents the subnet mask (`/24` or `255.255.255.0`).
- `InterfaceIndex`: The interface index from the `Get-NetAdapter` command.

### Finalize NAT Configuration

Run the following command to set up the NAT network:

```powershell
New-NetNat -Name "NATNetwork" -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix 192.168.200.0/24
```

![Virtual-Switch](screenshots/Virtual-Switch.png).

### Assign the NAT Virtual Switch to VMs in Hyper-V

1. Go back to **Hyper-V Manager** and assign the virtual network you just created (the **NAT Virtual Switch**) to each of your VMs.
2. Sign into each VM and configure a static **IPv4** address so that it's within the same range as the virtual switch (e.g., `192.168.200.x`).
3. This ensures that all VMs are on the same network, allowing them to communicate with each other and access the internet through the NAT gateway.

### Configure Kali Linux Static IP

1. Right-click on the network interface in the top-right corner of your screen.
2. Click on **Edit Connections**.
3. Choose **Wired Connection 1** and click on the gear icon.
4. Navigate to the **IPv4** tab.
5. In the **Method** section, select **Manual**.
6. Click on **Add** and input the IP address.
7. Set the network mask to **24**.
8. Input the default gateway you configured when setting up the virtual switch.
9. In the **DNS Server** field, enter Google's DNS IP: `8.8.8.8`.
10. Press **Save**.

![KaliIP](screenshots/kalistaticIP.png).

### Configure Ubuntu Server Static IP

To configure a static IP address on Ubuntu server we need to configure the yaml file that is stored in the '/etc/netplan' directory. First let's navigate to that directory.
```bash
cd /etc/netplan
```
This is where you'll find YAML files that control your network configuration. These files usually have a `.yaml` extension, and their names may vary depending on your installation.
To find the network configuration file you need to list all files, use the `ls` command.

```bash
ls -la
```

- **ls**: Lists files and directories.
- **-l**: Shows detailed info (permissions, owner, size).
- **-a**: Includes hidden files (files starting with .).

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.200.20/24]
      nameservers: 
        addresses: [8.8.8.8]
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 192.168.200.1
```
- **`eth0`**: This is the name of the network interface. Make sure to replace this with your actual interface name if it's different. You can find the interface name using the `ip addr` command.
- **`dhcp4: no`**: Disables DHCP, so the system won't try to automatically assign an IP address.
- **`addresses`**: This sets the static IP and subnet mask. In this example, the IP is `192.168.200.20` with a subnet of `/24` (which translates to `255.255.255.0`).
- **`nameservers`**: This sets the DNS server. In this example, weâ€™re using Googleâ€™s DNS (`8.8.8.8`).
- **`routes`**: This defines the default gateway for the network (`192.168.200.1`).

> **Tip**: Be careful with indentation. This YAML file require tabs, not spaces, for indentation.

## Brute Force Attack Simulation with Kali Linux

### Enable Remote Desktop on Windows 10 VM

1. **Go to Settings:**
   - On your Windows 10 VM, go to **Settings** > **System** > **Remote Desktop**.

2. **Enable Remote Desktop:**
   - Toggle the switch to **Enable Remote Desktop** to allow remote connections to the Windows 10 VM.
   - Click on **Select users that can remotely access this PC**.
   - Click on **Add** and enter the username `vblue`.
   - Click on **Check Names** to ensure the name is recognized.
   - Click **OK** to add the user.

### Install Crowbar on Kali Linux

1. **Install Crowbar:**
   - Open a terminal in Kali Linux and install the crowbar tool using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y crowbar
   ```

2. **Confirm Installation:**
   - After installation, you can confirm it's ready to use by typing:

   ```bash
   crowbar -h
   ```

   This will display the help menu, which shows various options and usage instructions.

### Prepare Wordlist for the Attack

1. **Navigate to Wordlists Directory:**
   - Kali Linux includes a popular wordlist called **rockyou.txt**. To access it, navigate to the wordlist directory:

   ```bash
   cd /usr/share/wordlists
   ```

2. **List Files in Directory:**
   - Run the `ls` command to list the contents of the wordlists directory. You should see `rockyou.txt`.

   ```bash
   ls
   ```

3. **Copy rockyou.txt to Project Directory:**
   - Copy the **rockyou.txt** wordlist to a new directory you created for this project on your Kali Linux desktop:

   ```bash
   cp rockyou.txt ~/Desktop/ad-project
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - The `~` symbol represents your home directory, which makes it easier to reference commonly used paths, such as your desktop or other personal folders, without needing to specify the full directory path.

4. **Reduce the Size of Wordlist:**
   - The **rockyou.txt** file is large (~135MB). Since we donâ€™t need the full list for this lab, weâ€™ll extract the first 50 passwords using the `head` command:

   ```bash
   head -n 50 rockyou.txt > password.txt
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - This command copies the first 50 lines (which contain 50 passwords) from `rockyou.txt` into a new text file called `password.txt`. By doing this, we reduce the size of the wordlist to a smaller size for this simulation, while still having a small list of passwords to attempt the RDP brute force attack.

5. **Verify the New Password File:**
   - Use the `cat` command to view the contents of the newly created `password.txt`:

   ```bash
   cat password.txt
   ```

### Add the User's Real Password to the List

1. **Edit the Password File:**
   - Now, weâ€™ll simulate a scenario where a user has set a weak password. Open the `password.txt` file in a text editor and add the userâ€™s actual password to the bottom of the list:

   ```bash
   nano password.txt
   ```

2. **Scroll to the Bottom:**
   - In the test editor, scroll to the bottom and add **Val's** real password at the end to mimic a scenario where weak, guessable passwords can be found in a wordlists.

   **Explanation:**
   - We add the real password 'V25fRYHyiksDeW' to simulate a situation where a user sets a common or weak password, which could easily be part of a large wordlist like **rockyou.txt**. In real-world attacks, attackers run much larger wordlists (thousands or even millions of entries) in an attempt to guess user passwords.

3. **Save and Exit:**
   - Press `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and hit `Enter` to save and exit the nano editor.

### Brute Force the RDP with Crowbar

1. **Check Crowbar Help Menu:**
   - First, review the options and syntax for crowbar by typing:

   ```bash
   crowbar -h
   ```

2. **Run the Brute Force Attack:**
   - Now, let's use the **crowbar** tool to brute force the RDP login on the Windows 10 VM. The command will use:
     - **-b rdp**: Specifies RDP as the target protocol.
     - **-u vblue**: Username of the target user (the Sales user we created earlier).
     - **-C password.txt**: Path to the password file.
     - **-s 192.168.200.10/32**: IP address of the target Windows 10 VM.

   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   crowbar -b rdp -u vblue -C password.txt -s 192.168.200.10/32
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - This command launches a brute force attack against the RDP service using the list of passwords in `password.txt` to try and log in as **vblue**. Since we manually added **Val's** real password to the list, we expect the attack to succeed in a shorter amount of time compared to running the entire **rockyou.txt** file.

## Analyzing Telemetry in Splunk

### Access the Splunk Web Portal

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the Splunk web portal using the IP address of the Splunk Vm we created earlier (e.g., `https://192.168.200.20:8000`).
2. Log in with your credentials.

### Set Up Your Search

1. In the search bar at the top of the Splunk interface, enter the following search query:
   ```
   index="endpoint" vblue EventCode=4625
   ```
   - Here, we're filtering for events associated with the compromised user `vblue`and **4625** (Windows Event ID), which indicates **failed logon attempt**.

2. To focus on recent activity, select the time frame to the **last 15 minutes** on the right side of the search bar.

![Splunktele1](screenshots/Splunk-telemetry1.png).

### Filter by Event Code

1. Scroll down the results a bit until you find the **Event Code** section.
2. Click on the EventCode in the **INTERESTING FIELDS** on the left of your screen and select **4625**.

### Analyzing Failed Logins

- After applying the filter, you should see multiple entries indicating failed logon attempts. 
- You can identify that these are likely brute-force attempts since the attacker tried **50 passwords at the same exact time**.

![Splunktele3](screenshots/Splunk-telemetry3.png).

### Check for Successful RDP Connections

1. Now, change the Event Code filter to **EventCode=4624**, which represents **successful logon**.
2. You should see at least one successful login that coincides with the brute-force attempts.

![Splunktele5](screenshots/Splunk-telemetrykaliIP.png).

### Review Details of Successful Logins

1. Click on **Show All 70 Lines** to see the detailed logs associated with the successful login event.
2. Here we can see that the successful RDP connection originated from our Kali Linux host and its IP address.
